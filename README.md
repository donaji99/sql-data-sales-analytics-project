5. **Magnitude** ‚Äì Evaluating the total size and impact of sales.  
   [Script](scripts/5_magnitude_analysis.sql)  
   ![Revenue by Country](images/5..png)  
    The United States has the highest number of customers (7,482), making it the largest market, followed by Australia with 3,591. This suggests a strong sales presence in the U.S.

   ![Revenue by Customer](images/5.Revenue%20by%20customer.png)  
   The top five customers generate almost the same revenue individually (~13,298), showing a similar purchasing behavior among the most valuable clients.
